Private npm from Nodejitsu is a cloud hosted or on-premise solution for reliably publishing and collaborating on Javascript code for your team. The private modules (or private packages) in your private npm registry are like the production cousin to your private repositories in your private Github (or other DVCS). The private registry offers the same conveience features:

* Secure module distribution with 2048-bit SSL
* Easy team management from our [web interface][web-interface]
* Easier module sharing and deployment workflows
* High reliability with an isolated and replicated npm infrastructure

Got it? Great! Why don't you check-out the [Quickstart][quickstart]?
