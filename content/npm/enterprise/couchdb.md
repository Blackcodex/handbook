## Setup CouchDB

This will depend on the type of operating system you are installing on but we recommend
installing from
[source](https://github.com/opsmezzo/composer-systems/blob/master/database/couchdb/scripts/install.sh)
if available or use a tool like
[`build-couchdb`](https://github.com/jhs/build-couchdb).

After this is complete, move the registry couch file you copied over into the
correct folder (based on your installation) and restart or start up the couch!
